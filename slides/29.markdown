#### Naming discrepancies

Components often have:

```js
var get = require('get');
```

But the package is published on npm as `get-component`.

With the `browser` field you can rewrite those require statements:

```json
  "browser": {
    "get": "get-component"
  }
```

Then, pull request etc. etc.
